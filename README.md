# RESTful LAMP
So due to restrictions placed on my by school network I created my RESTful home pages with some .htaccess trickery and mostly php

## api.php
As soon as I'm certain this works as intended I'm moving all this stuff into index.php.

## Main features
* REST(testing)
* .htaccess trickery (in dev.)
* Database agnostism (backlog)
* Authentication (backlog)
* Web editor (backlog)

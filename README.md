# RESTful LAMP
So due to restrictions placed on my by school network I created my RESTful home pages with some .htaccess trickery and mostly php

## api.php
As soon as I'm certain this works as intended I'm moving all this stuff into index.php. 

### Main features
* REST
* .htaccess trickery
* Database agnostism
* Authentication (not yet implemented)
* Web editor (Because uploading manually tedious and boring. Needs work)
